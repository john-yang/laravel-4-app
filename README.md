Iteration #1:
---------------

For this first iteration lets just focus 
on these three entities:

Organization
Create, Read and Update
Account
Create, Read and Update
Instance
List in table, and Read individually.

Here are the most critical use cases:

Use Case #1:
-------------------
As a sys admin I should be able to create an organization 
and provide the AWS API keys for an account. Upon creation, 
the system would call a python script to collect data. 

*This may be a long operation, so we would
 need some dummy progress bar animation

Use Case #2:
--------------------
As a support associate I should be able select an organization, 
and view all instances for all accounts of the selected organization. 


The instances page would have a table 
containing the following fields : 

[column_name] => [UI label]
id   =>  label: Instance Id
tags  =>  Tags       // Heads up. This will be JSON string
_state  =>  State
public_dns_name => Public DNS Name
ip_address  =>  Public IP             
private_dns_name  => Private DNS Name
private_ip_address  => Private IP
instance_type  =>  Instance Type
region  =>  Region
account_name ??? (this is low priority)


Use Case #3:
---------------------
As a support associate I should able click a 
“Refresh Button” in Account pages. (Under the 
hood a python script will be called 
and take care of syncing data)
